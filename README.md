2- Layer Perceptron with mnist and cifar-10 dataset classification
This project has been made for the course Machine Learning offered by the Athens University of Economics and Business in spring semester of 2020.
In report you can see the details of the project and the results of the accuracy and other metrics.(in GR)
I have made a 2 layer perceptron with 1 hidden layer and softmax function in order to classify the mnist dataset and the cifar-10 dataset.
