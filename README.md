# 2-Layer-perceptron-for-classification
#### 2- Layer Perceptron with mnist and cifar-10 dataset classification <br>
This project has been made for the course **Machine Learning** offered by the *Athens University of Economics and Business* in spring semester of 2020. <br>
In report you can see the details of the project and the results of the accuracy and other metrics.(in GR) <br>
I have made a *2 layer perceptron* with *1 hidden layer* and *softmax* function in order to classify the **mnist** dataset and the **cifar-10** dataset.
